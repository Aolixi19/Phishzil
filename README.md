# 🛡 How PhishZil Works – Step by Step (Simple Version)

---

✅ **Step 1: PhishZil is Installed on Your Device**  
Once you install the PhishZil app on your phone or computer, it quietly runs in the background — watching for any dangerous messages or files.

---

✅ **Step 2: A Message Arrives (Email, SMS, WhatsApp, etc.)**  
You receive a message that includes:

- A suspicious link (e.g., “click here to claim your reward”), or
- A file (e.g., PDF, Word document, ZIP folder)

---

✅ **Step 3: PhishZil Instantly Scans the Link or File**  
PhishZil jumps into action the moment something enters your device. It checks:

- Where the link leads
- If the domain looks suspicious
- Whether the file hides anything dangerous (like fake invoices or embedded malware)

---

✅ **Step 4: PhishZil Decides if It's Safe**  
Using smart AI and backend threat intelligence, PhishZil decides:

- 🟢 **Safe?** → You can click or open it freely.
- 🔴 **Dangerous?** → It blocks it instantly — before you can interact with it.

---

✅ **Step 5: Dangerous Items Are Disarmed or Blocked**

- Links are disabled or replaced with safe warning messages.
- Files with hidden threats are blocked, quarantined, or opened in a protected sandbox.

---

✅ **Step 6: You Get a Clear Warning**  
If something harmful is found, PhishZil shows a red warning screen:

> “⚠️ Phishing link detected and neutralized.”
>
> Or: “🚫 Dangerous file blocked to protect you.”

---

✅ **Step 7: Everything Is Logged for You (Optional)**  
If you're an advanced user — admin, parent, or enterprise team — PhishZil can show:

- What was blocked
- Where it came from
- What action was taken
- Export logs for review or reporting

---

### 🔐 Summary

> **PhishZil catches the threat before you click.**  
> You stay protected. No stress. No scams. Just peace of mind.
